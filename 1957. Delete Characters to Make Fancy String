# Solution 1:

class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = 2
        regex = re.compile(rf"((.)\2{{{n-1}}})\2+") 
        return regex.sub(r"\1", s)

Explanation:
{{: this double brace represents a literal brace in an f-string
{n-1} injects the value of n-1, so together with the additional (double) brace-wrap, this {{{n-1}}} produces {2} when n is 3.
The outer capture group captures the maximum allowed repetition of a character
The additional \2+ captures more subsequent occurrences of that same character, so these are the characters that need removal.
The replacement with \1 thus reproduces the allowed repetition, but omits the additional repetition of that same character.
